<h1>Library-3D-.OBJ</h1>

This repository made with the idea of using Blender addon asset Flinger, get spoken addon on the next link https://github.com/BlenderAid/Asset-Flinger. Read below licence for more info

In order to use this more easily, u can install Assets Flinger for Blender, and point to this directory on your PC, it is not required but will make your life easier appending .OBJ to the scene.

If u wanna contribute to the pack, directly by adding new assets, please use the default scene render that we have already build for it.
